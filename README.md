# kmmCompose

This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, iOS. UI of the application is fully based on `Compose Multiplatform`.

* `/composeApp` contains the Android application, as well as the presentation layer of the application.
* `/sources` contains `data` and `domain` layers with their api/impl modules, as well as the `entity` module that is shared between `data` and `domain`.
* `/iosApp` contains the iOS application. Even if youâ€™re sharing your UI with Compose Multiplatform, 
  you need this entry point for your iOS app. This is also where SwiftUI code should go if required.

## Limitations

This is the list of limitations that I encountered when building the project:

1. Multiplatform cannot use resources spread in different modules when building ios. It is a limitation of compose-resources library. 
For now, all should be in 1 module that is why presentation layer code has to be in a single module.
